# Enigma

### Functionality
- 3 Project does the thing! (I believe it does based off all the parameters) Did not attempt 4

### Object Oriented Programming
- 2.7 No inheritance or modules used, only had one class but it takes in the same arguments

### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
- 3 I believe I used the correct formatting for my spec files (using the method '#' and '::' for class methods)

### Test Driven Development
- 3 made a test before every method was created, however did not use use mocks or stubs
